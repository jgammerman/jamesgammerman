title: Anomaly Detection based on Association Rules and Conformal Prediction
abstract: "We propose a novel technique based on a combination of association rule learning and conformal prediction in its label-dependent
form. The non-conformity score is not based directly on a classification algorithm, but
aggregates information of many association rules that can be extracted from the data, and
exceptions from them.
As an application, we use customer data from UKB. There are multiple fields indicating
if a customer is an Industrial Corporation (INC) or Small/Medium-sized Enterprise (SME).
We will consider these as labels. Often these labels are incorrect or inconsistent across the
SAP system. The aim is to use machine learning to identify inconsistencies and potential
errors."
