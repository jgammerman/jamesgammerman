title: "Multi-Level Conformal Clustering: A Distribution-free Technique for Clustering and Anomaly Detection"
abstract: "In this work we present a clustering technique called multi-level conformal clustering (MLCC). The technique is hierarchical in nature because it can be performed at multiple significance levels which yields greater insight into the data than...
