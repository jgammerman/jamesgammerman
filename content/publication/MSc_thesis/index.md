title: "Predictive Maintenance with Conformal and Probabilistic Prediction: A Commercial Case Study"
abstract: "Industrial companies usually own assets which are prone to breaking down.
Each year vast quantities of money are spent on maintenance to fix these
assets after they have failed. This study presents a set of predictive maintenance
techniques which could help combat this problem.

A large set of sensor data taken from a subsystem of a commercial gas terminal
in the UK was analysed. We first used a recently developed machine
learning technique called conformal clustering to show that there are patterns
in this data, indicating predictability, and also to identify anomalies
in the data. We then proposed a way to identify which metrics may explain
why the subsystem has failed.

Finally we built a model to predict failure of the subsystem in probabilistic
form, and ran experiments to optimise it.

We believe that the methodology developed in this project could be generalised
to many such cases when large data sets from industrial sensors are
available."
