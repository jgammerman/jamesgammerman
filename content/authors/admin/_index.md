I am a data scientist working at the British energy supplier [Centrica (British Gas)](https://www.centrica.com/).   
I have 4 years of professional experience in data science, and 8 years in data analysis more generally.

My main area of interest is machine learning, in which I have an MSc from Royal Holloway University of London (2018). I enjoy applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to business data. I have also recently started publishing research related to my commercial work in academic journals.

My programming language of choice is R but I am also comfortable with Python. I am currently gaining experience with cloud technologies.

Outside of my career my main interests are sports, technology and travelling.
