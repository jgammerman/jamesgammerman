I am a data scientist working at the British energy supplier [Centrica (British Gas)](https://www.centrica.com/).   
I have three years of professional experience in data science, and seven years in data analysis more generally.

My main area of interest is machine learning, in which I have a Masters degree from Royal Holloway University of London (2018). I enjoy applying machine learning and statistical techniques to business data. I have also recently started publishing research in academic journals.

Outside of my career my main hobbies are socialising, sports, music and learning languages.
