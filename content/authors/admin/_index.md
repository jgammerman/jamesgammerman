I am a data scientist at the British energy company [Centrica](https://www.centrica.com/). I have three years of professional experience in data science, and seven years in data analysis more generally.

My main area of interest is machine learning, in which I have a Masters degree from Royal Holloway University of London (2018). I have also recently started publishing research in academic journals.

Outside of my career my main interests are socialising, sports, music and learning (natural!) languages.
